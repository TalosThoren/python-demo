# Python demonstration - Assignment

## Description

I've been asked to perform the following tasks:

### Array Comparison

Compare the contents of two lists of numbers (integers). One list is a target
list and the other list can be thought of as the list to operate on. This has
been called the current list in the assignment.

The goal is to output a list of additions and a list of deletions that need to
be made to the current list in order to make it identical to the target list.

The assignment's examples are ordered, but it is likely safe to assume this
should work for un-ordered lists.

### Social Media Analysis

Given a csv file that represents relationships between posts and reposts on a
social media network, analyze the total number of followers a given post has. We
are told it is safe to assume that now two posts share common followers
(including reposts.)

The csv file contains data for postId, repostId, and followrs (count of
followers) and unique posts will have a repostId of '-1'.

*Note:* I only paraphrase the assignment in this readme to ensure that I do not
attempt to apply the license of this repository to the original assigment
document, which I did not author.
